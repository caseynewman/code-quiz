# Code Quiz

## Description

I built the Code Quiz as a tool to help test users' coding knowledge, and for myself to learn more about the DOM and interactivity of JavaScript. In building this project, I first created the framework within the HTML. After creating the structure I needed, I learned how to dynamically add content to an application with JavaScript as opposed to hardcoding it in. As this was my first JavaScript project from scratch, there was a lot of trial and error, but that ultimately helped me get a better grasp on what I was doing.

I used classes in CSS to indicate whether or not a selected answer was correct. I learned the importance of breaking down larger functions into smaller functions for each individual action. I also gained a better understanding of local storage and how to save key value pairs to it, as well as how to retrieve them.

## Usage

To take the Code Quiz, click the start button on the home page. The timer begins when you hit start. Answer as many questions correctly as you can within the time limit. If you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from your time. The number of seconds you have left at the end is your score. Enter your initials at the end to save your score, and play again to try to beat it.

## Credits

For this project, I worked with a tutor, Mazin Abed, to gain a better understanding of local storage and how to use it. I also worked with AskBCS Learning Assistants for more guidance with tracking scores and saving them at the end. I was also fortunate enough to have a programmer friend answer some questions for me throughout the process.
