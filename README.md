# Code Quiz

## Description

I built the Code Quiz as a tool to help test the users' coding knowledge, and to learn more about the the DOM and interactivity of JavaScript. In building this project, I learned how to dynamically add content to an application as opposed to hardcoding it in.

## Usage

To take the Code Quiz, click the start button on the home page. The timer begins when you hit start. Answer as many questions correctly as you can within the time limit. If you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from your time. The number of seconds you have left at the end is your score. Enter your initials at the end to save your score. Play again to try to beat your score.

## Credits

For this project, I worked with a tutor, Mazin Abed, to gain a better understanding of local storage and how to use it. I also worked with AskBCS Learning Assistants for more guidance with tracking scores and saving them at the end. I was also fortunate enough to have a programmer friend answer some questions for me throughout the process.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
